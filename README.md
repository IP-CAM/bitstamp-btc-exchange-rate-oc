This OpenCart extension initializes the Bitcoin (BTC) currency inside OpenCart and updates the exchange rate every minute to remain current. It calculates the average trade value (from high and low values obtained) or pulls the last trade value, all from Bitstamp, and uses whichever one is friendlier for the merchant thus lessening the currency risk.

This extension only works with USD currency supported by the Bitstamp API.
